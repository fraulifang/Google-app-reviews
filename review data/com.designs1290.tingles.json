[{"Content": "I love the tingles app. It's my go to when my mainstream ASMRtists haven't posted on YouTube. The app is fantastic but I think the overall UI could use some fine tuning. For example looking at specific triggers, only 15 videos show up when I believe the whole archive should be showing. That may need a fixing. As well app crashes when Facebook is open. Weird but reoccurring.
