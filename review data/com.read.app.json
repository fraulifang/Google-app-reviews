A few months ago I started getting redirects when reading my feeds, it's really annoying and only happens with this app so I'm guessing it's the developer idea in order to generate income. Honestly I would happily pay for the app as I use it on a daily basis. I'm also getting crashes every now and then. It would be nice to have an option to clear caches as right now it's taking up over 1Gb I cannot get rid of unless I clear all data.
