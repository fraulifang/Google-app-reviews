Its unnecessary, and the cherry on top is that it didnt even work after downloading. The app just kept trying to log me in, but any time I'd attempt to it would just freeze up. I spent over 30 minutes trying to retrieve my tickets with this app and eventually had to call customer service. All told it took me over an hour to finally get my tickets. I will not be using this service again, and unless you dont value your time id suggest finding somewhere else as well.", "Numbers": "2", "Date": "May 27, 2018"}, {"Content": "The app hasn't crashed yet, but it's nothing exciting either. The swiping between your tickets is often frustrating because the pull down to refresh gets in the way. Seat Geek as a whole, sucks. Their policies and procedures are dumb and unhelpful. Even if you give them a credit card, they will make you send a picture id to verify and add a bank account if their garbage system can't do it online for whatever reason. And then they require two business days turnaround on that. So good luck if you want to set up on Friday to sell tickets for that weekend. Their system won't allow you to actually remove tickets from your account. When you send them, they stay in your account, and to receive them, you have to make an account and then you can't remove them from that account even if you download them. Their customer service is a bunch of canned email replies. Their fees are higher than stub hub. Their only nice feature they have is scan into the games, but guess what? You can scan into the games with your pdf tickets too. So, to summarize: Seat Geek sucks.", "Numbers": "3", "Date": "May 6, 2018"}, {"Content": "Quick and easy to use.
